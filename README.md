# Amazin' Grace
Notes and inspiration from and about Grace Hopper, quite literally the mother of all hackers.


## History

### WW II

 - attempt to enter the navy and denial based on age (too old) height-to-weight, and value (to the war effort) as a mathematician at vasser
 - Membership in the reserves (on a weight exemption), and subsequent membership of WAVES (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service).  WAVE officers were trained at Smith college, enlisted trained at Oklahoma A&M.
 - Assignment to Harvard Computation Project and work on the Harvard Mk I

 
### Eckert-Mauchley and the UNIVAC

 - Creation of the first compiler (which translated math symbols to binary)
 - B-0 compiler, aka FLOW-MATIC - designed to translate automatable business tasks like payroll and billing into machine code.  Hopper and her staff teach UNIVACs I + II 20 english statements.  Her first paper on the compiler was in 1952, it would be three years before her ideas gain acceptance.
 - One of two technical advisers to the CODASYL executive committee to define COBOL, which is partially based on ideas from FLOW-MATIC.  The first COBOL spec is published in 1959
 - Work on the standardization and validation of compilers - these were the prototype for international standards for programming languages
 

### Current Events

 - Grace hopper celebration presented by [anitaB](https://ghc.anitab.org/) (currently in session as of 11/17/20)
 
 	Talks and conferences about advancing women in computing.

## Facts

- Grace was posthumously awarded the _Presidentail Medal of Freedom_ by Barack Obama.  She had also been granted the _Distinguished Service Medal_.  The two are the highest honors available for civilians and non-combatant service personnell, respectively.  We think she got shortchanged anyhow. 
- Grace is the reason you don't have to be a mathematician to program!  She was the first to think of machine language as abstractible to english, and had to hold on to a working design of a linker while she waited for the rest of the world to comprehend the power behind the concept.
- Her team for the Harvard Mark II may be responsible for the term "debugging" after finding a moth in a relay.
- She correctly predicted the miniaturization of the processor, often using a foot-long wire to display the distance light traveled in a nanosecond

### Papers by Grace

 - [Automatic Coding for Digital Computers](http://www.bitsavers.org/magazines/Computers_And_Automation/195509.pdf) 
 
	 Grace elegantly describes the job of a coder, an analyst, and a programmer (different specializations at the time), and the limitations of the computer: "_The computer is an extremely fast moron._".  Scroll to page 21 for her article.
	 
 - [Automatic Programming: The A 2 Compiler System pt. 2](http://www.bitsavers.org/magazines/Computers_And_Automation/195510.pdf)
 
	 A much more technical treatise on memory management as concerned the Univac I
	 
 - [The Education of a Computer](http://xover.mud.at/~marty/iug2/p243-hopper.pdf)
 
	 An incredible insight into Commodore Hopper's systems-oriented worldview.  Within are also discussed kernel, subroutines, threading, and abstraction.
	 
 - [Keynote Address for ?](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/800025.1198341)
 
	 I wasn't able to figure out where this keynote was given.  She sort of tears the establishment a new one re: their reticence to use english to program.  It's a worthy read.
	 
 - [Smithsonian Archive of Grace's technical writing](https://sova.si.edu/details/NMAH.AC.0324?s=0&n=10&t=C&q=&i=0)
 
 - [New Types of Irreducibility Criteria](https://math.yale.edu/sites/default/files/grace_murray_hopper_thesis_0.pdf)
 
 	This is Grace's thesis. It's math-dense, but provides insight into the mind that eventually gave us the foundations for the abstractions we use in programming today.
